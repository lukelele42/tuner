This is a webapp that plays notes when buttons are clicked to tune the guitar and banjo in standard tuning.

The photo for the acoustic guitar comes from seekpng.com (contributer unknown) and the (beautiful!) banjo photo comes from cleanpng.com from user Fiyzah.  Thank you so much!

The guitar notes are mp3 files from freesound.org from veteran user harri. Thanks harri!

Finally, the "banjo" audio is also from freesound.org, courtesy of user ChaoticNoise and their Yamaha PS-55.
